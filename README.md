# Amazon-sales
This Python project involves a thorough analysis of Amazon sales data. The insights derived from the analysis are as follows:

1. **Product Size Preference:** The majority of customers prefer the M-Size, which indicates a dominant preference for this particular size among buyers.

2. **Courier Usage and Status:** The courier is the preferred method of shipment, and most orders are successfully delivered, highlighting effective logistics management.

3. **Product Category Popularity:** The sales are dominated by T-shirts, which are the preferred category among buyers.

4. **Retailer Dominance:** Almost 99.3% of buyers are retailers, while only 0.7% represent B2B buyers, emphasizing a strong presence in the retail market.

5. **Fulfillment Channel:** Amazon is the preferred fulfillment channel for the majority of orders, indicating a high level of trust in Amazon's services.

6. **Geographical Distribution:** Maharashtra is the state with the highest buyer count, underscoring a substantial customer base in that region.

7. **State-wise Analysis:** The top 10 states are identified based on order counts, with Maharashtra leading. This reinforces the state's prominence as a market for the products.


The project concludes that the business has a significant foothold in the Maharashtra state, catering primarily to retailers. It benefits from Amazon's fulfillment services and witnesses robust demand for T-shirts, particularly in M-Size, which appears to be a customer favorite.
